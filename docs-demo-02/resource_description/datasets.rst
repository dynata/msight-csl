:class:`Datasets` are collections of data that are subject to analysis. The
MarketSight platform is specifically used to perform statistical analyses on
Datasets and the information that they contain.

Datasets can be uploaded to the MarketSight platform in a variety of formats,
including via file upload and via API.

Additional resources are derived from Datasets, such as :class:`Crosstabs` (data
tables) and :class:`Charts`, and changes to the underlying Dataset's data will
therefore flow through and affect content whose source is a given Dataset.
