  Access Token
    A cryptographically secure :class:`str <python:str>` generated by the
    :term:`Dynata Reporting & Analytics API` that is used to authenticate your
    requests against the API (i.e. verify that your requests are coming from
    an authorized user).

  Calculation
    A mathematical metric that is calculated from your underlying :term:`Dataset`
    when calculating a :term:`Crosstab`. Think of this as a "metric" that is
    shown in your data table.

    .. seealso::

      * :doc:`Using the MarketSight API Client <using>`: :ref:`Calculations <crosstab_calculations>`

  Column Variable
    A :term:`Variable` that is used in a :term:`Crosstab`, where its values are
    placed in a column across the top of the resulting data table.

  Conditional Variable
    A type of :Term:`Discrete Variable` that is calculated dynamically based on
    the values of other :term:`variables <Variable>` within the dataset.

  Continuous Variable
    A type of :term:`Variable` where the "raw" value in the data is equivalent to
    its "human-readable" form. For example, if we have a variable
    "Number of Minutes Spent Watching TV" and the respondent was asked to supply
    a specific number, this would be considered a continuous variable.

  Crosstab
    Crosstabs are statistical data tables produced by the Dynata Reporting &
    Analytics platform from your :term:`datasets <Dataset>`. They are
    analytically calculated and support a variety of configurable options.

    .. seealso::

      * :doc:`API Reference <api>`: :class:`Crosstabs <marketsight.application_api.Crosstabs>` resource
      * :doc:`Using the MarketSight API Client <using>`: :ref:`Analyzing Your Data <analyzing_your_data>`

  Dataset
    Datasets are a collection of data that is subject to statistical analysis.
    Typically within the Dynata Reporting & Analytics platform datasets contain
    information collected from one or more surveys.

    .. seealso::

      * :doc:`API Reference <api>`: :class:`Datasets <marketsight.application_api.Datasets>` resource
      * :doc:`Using the MarketSight API Client <using>`: :ref:`Managing Datasets <managing_datasets>`

  Dataset Labeling Workbook
    A Microsoft Excel file that can be used to provide metadata about your
    :term:`dataset`. This metadata can include details like a listing of the
    :term:`Variables <Variable>` in the dataset, relevant labels for those
    variables, and definitions of
    :term:`User-defined Variables <User-defined Variable>`.

    .. seealso::

      * :doc:`Using the MarketSight API Client <using>`: :ref:`Working with Dataset Labeling Workbooks <working_with_dataset_labeling_workbooks>`
      * :doc:`API Reference <api>`: :meth:`Datasets.create <marketsight.application_api.Datasets.create>`
      * :doc:`API Reference <api>`: :meth:`Datasets.get_metadata <marketsight.application_api.Datasets.get_metadata>`

  Data View
    Data Views are data tables that show the uncalculated records from a given
    :term:`Dataset`, filtered according to whatever configuration has been
    applied. Only those :term:`Variables <Variable>` you have selected for
    inclusion will be shown in the columns of a Data View.

  Date / Time Variable
    A type of :term:`Variable` where the data it contains represents either a
    date (e.g. "January 1, 2021"), a time (e.g. "12:34:56"), or a datetime
    (e.g. "January 1, 2021 at 12:34:56").

  Discrete Variable
    A type of :term:`Variable` where each of the possible answer choices have
    labels. This enables the "raw" representation of the variable to differ from
    the human-readable representation. For example, a variable "Gender" may have
    two "raw" values: 1 and 2. But 1 may have a label of "Male" and 2 may have
    a label of "Female".

    .. note::

      Discrete Variables may either be *nominal* or *ordinal*. A nominal variable
      will have no inherent order to it, for example a list of magazine titles.
      For an ordinal variable, the order of values will have inherent meaning as
      well (e.g. for a rating scale where 1 is "Bad" and 5 is "Good").

  Dynata Reporting & Analytics API
    The RESTful API that provides programmatic access to the Dynata Reporting
    and Analytics platform. This API is designed to allow your systems to
    integrate with Dynata's analytical tools, to automate a variety of analyses,
    or to automate the exchange of data between Dynata's platforms and your own.

  Filter Variable
    A type of :term:`Variable` that is used as a convenient way of specifying a
    set of rules to filter the data included in a :term:`Crosstab`.

    .. note::

      While a :term:`Crosstab` can have an arbitrary set of filters constructed
      and applied to it, :term:`Filter Variables <Filter Variable>` can be an
      easy and convenient mechanism to simplify the process.

      * :doc:`Using the MarketSight API Client <using>`: :ref:`Analyzing Your Data <analyzing_your_data>`

  Job
    A task that is created within the :term:`Dynata Reporting & Analytics API`.
    It is asynchronous, which  means that while the platform executes the task
    you can continue to interact with the platform in other ways. When the task
    is complete, you may be able to perform additional operations related to
    the outcome of that task.

  Key Findings Portal
    A component of the Dynata Reporting & Analytics platform that allows you to
    share content (e.g. dashboards, crosstabs, charts, files, etc.) with people
    who may not be paid users of the platform. This is a great resource for
    producing insights and content within the platform, and then securely sharing
    it with the people who need to see it.

  Key Findings User
    An individual who has been granted access to the :term:`Key Findings Portal`,
    which gives them the ability to see content from the Dynata Reporting &
    Analytics platform that you have chosen to share with them (whether they are
    paid users of the platform or not).

  Mathematical Variable
    A type of :term:`Continuous Variable` that is calculated based on the values
    of other continuous variables in the :term:`Dataset`.

  Multiple Response Variable
    A type of :term:`Variable` that is actually composed of multiple related
    :term:`Discrete Variables <Discrete Variable>`. Think of this variable as
    representing a "multiple choice" question, where the respondent could
    select multiple answers at the same time.

    .. note::

      In most cases, Multiple Response Variables are automatically produced
      when loading :class:`Datasets <marketsight.application_api.Datasets>` into
      the Dynata Reporting & Analytics platform. However, you can also construct
      them yourself as :term:`User-defined Variables <User-defined Variable>`.

  Predecessor Variable
    A :term:`Variable` whose value is used as an input when calculating a
    :term:`User-defined Variable`.

  Regrouping Variable
    A type of :term:`Discrete Variable` that allows you to group values from a
    different :term:`variable`. For example, if you have a :term:`Discrete Variable`
    that contains a rating scale you may want to create a new variable that
    groups those ratings into "Positive" or "Negative" categories. If you have a
    :term:`Continuous Variable` that contains the respondent's age, you may want
    to group them into convenient age group buckets.

  Resource
    A conceptual entity exposed by the :term:`Dynata Reporting & Analytics API`.
    Think of a resource as a "thing" or a "noun" that the API exposes and which
    you and your systems can create, retrieve, update, or delete various
    resources depending on your authorization level.

      * :doc:`Using the MarketSight API Client <using>`: :ref:`Working with Resources <working_with_resources>`

  Row Variable
    A :term:`Variable` that is used in a :term:`Crosstab`, where its values are
    placed in rows across the left-hand side of the resulting data table.

  System Administrator
    A Dynata employee who is authorized to perform various administrative tasks
    within the Dynata Reporting & Analytics platform, including adjusting
    account settings, billing details, or technical configuration as needed.

  Text Variable
    A type of :term:`Variable` that is encoded as a raw string within the
    underlying data. This type of variable is primarily consumed through the
    use of :class:`Data_Views` and using the Dynata Reporting & Analytics
    platform's advanced analytics (using the R scripting language).

  User-defined Variable
    A type of :term:`Variable` that is not natively present within your
    :term:`dataset`, but instead is calculated or derived within the
    Dynata Reporting & Analytics platform. The platform supports several types
    of user-defined variables:

      * :term:`Regrouping Variable`
      * :term:`Multiple Response Variable`
      * :term:`Conditional Variable`
      * :term:`Mathematical Variable`
      * :term:`Filter Variable`
      * :term:`Weight Variable`

  Variable
    A column of data in your respondent-level :class:`Datasets`. You can think
    of them as properties that apply to each of your respondents, and they
    typically represent the answer that the respondent gave to one of your
    survey questions.

    The platform supports several types of variables:

      * :term:`Discrete Variables <Discrete Variable>`
      * :term:`Continuous Variables <Continuous Variable>`
      * :term:`Text Variables <Text Variable>`
      * :term:`Date / Time Variables <Date / Time Variable>`
      * :term:`Multiple Response Variables <Multiple Response Variable>`
      * :term:`Weight Variables <Weight Variable>`
      * :term:`User-defined Variables <User-defined Variable>`

        * :term:`Regrouping Variables <Regrouping Variable>`
        * :term:`Conditional Variables <Conditional Variable>`
        * :term:`Mathematical Variables <Mathematical Variable>`
        * :term:`Filter Variables <Filter Variable>`

      * :doc:`API Reference <api>`: :class:`Variables <marketsight.application_api.Variables>` resource
      * :doc:`Using the MarketSight API Client <using>`: :ref:`Working with Variables <working_with_variables>`

  Weight Variable
    A type of :term:`Variable` that is explicitly used to weight your
    respondent-level data when calculating :term:`crosstabs <Crosstab>`.

    .. note::

      Using the Dynata Reporting & Analytics platform, you can calculate
      weight variables as :term:`User-defined Variables <User-defined Variable>`
      or you can also have them originally contained in your data as a
      :term:`Continuous Variable`.
