:class:`Files` are just that: files that can be uploaded to the Dynata
Reporting & Analytics platform, which you can then choose to share with
:term:`Key Findings Users <Key Findings User>` or which you can then download
from the platform.

Typical use cases for using :class:`Files` is to keep information related to
your :class:`Datasets` alongside your data, such as a copy of the questionnaire
that produced a given dataset or the final presentation that was delivered based
on a given dataset.
