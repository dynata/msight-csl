Crosstabs are data tables produced by the MarketSight platform from your
datasets. The data tables produced are calculated based on a robust set of
options which you can configure within the application or using the
MarketSight API. These options determine what data gets calculated, how the
calculation is performed, and what data is returned.

The data tables produced can be readily visualized using :class:`Charts` and
:class:`Dashboards` within the MarketSight platform.
