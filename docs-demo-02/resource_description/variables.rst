:class:`Variables` are columns of data in your respondent-level
:class:`Datasets`. You can think of them as properties that apply to each of
your respondents, and they typically represent the answer that the respondent
gave to one of your survey questions.

The Dynata Reporting & Analytics platform supports a variety of
:class:`Variables`, including:

  * :term:`Discrete Variables <Discrete Variable>`
  * :term:`Continuous Variables <Continuous Variable>`
  * :term:`Text Variables <Text Variable>`
  * :term:`Date / Time Variables <Date / Time Variable>`
  * :term:`Multiple Response Variables <Multiple Response Variable>`
  * :term:`Weight Variables <Weight Variable>`
  * :term:`User-defined Variables <User-defined Variable>`

    * :term:`Regrouping Variables <Regrouping Variable>`
    * :term:`Conditional Variables <Conditional Variable>`
    * :term:`Mathematical Variables <Mathematical Variable>`
    * :term:`Filter Variables <Filter Variable>`

Typically, :class:`Variables` will be automatically created for you when you
upload your :class:`Datasets` into the platform. However, you can also
manipulate them:

  * programmatically using the :class:`Variables` resource
  * using the :term:`Dataset Labeling Workbook` for your dataset
  * inside the MarketSight user interface
