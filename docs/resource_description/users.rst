:class:`Users` are people who are associated with an :class:`Account <Accounts>`.
Throughout the MarketSight platform, they are uniquely identified by their
username, which may or may not be an email address and is used to authenticate
the User both within the MarketSight application and the MarketSight API.

Users are allowed to perform various actions depending on their Account's type
and the permissions assigned to them.

Users may also have access to multiple :class:`Accounts`.
